# Optimized Price Recommender System

This project presents a machine learning-based framework designed to help businesses determine optimal product prices that maximize profitability while maintaining customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement

Identifying the right price point is a critical challenge for businesses aiming to balance profit margins and customer retention. This project addresses this issue by building an optimized price recommender that learns from historical pricing and sales data.

## Approach

- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and preprocessed product and sales datasets, handled missing values, and removed inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized trends in pricing, demand, and revenue to identify influencing factors.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created features such as price elasticity, discount rate, customer segments, and product categories.
- **Model Development**: Trained and compared multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to predict optimal pricing.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics such as RÂ², MAE, and RMSE.

## Solution

The final model outputs pricing recommendations based on product characteristics and historical performance. It supports business teams in making data-informed decisions that improve profitability.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Learnings

- Importance of domain-specific feature engineering in price prediction
- Challenges in balancing model complexity and interpretability
- Use of regression models for optimization tasks beyond prediction

## Future Work

- Incorporate real-time pricing APIs and competitor pricing data
- Develop a lightweight web-based dashboard for non-technical stakeholders
- Explore reinforcement learning for dynamic pricing optimization
